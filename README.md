9. To open: Go inside the Practice Helper folder. Then into the dist folder. Then into the Kingdom Hearts Practice Helper folder. Then open the Kingdom Hearts Practice Helper.exe
10. I would recommend right clicking on the .exe and hover over "send to" and click desktop to make a desktop shortcut of the file
11. Once open, click the Load Saves button
12. Select the world you want to practice
13. Select the file you want to practice
14. Once the file you want to practice is selected, while tabbed into your Kingdom Hearts game, press the button command on your controller to load an auto save. L1+L2+R1+R2+right on d-pad

## Add Custom Saves
1. Update your autosave.dat by doing a room transition or saving then reloading the game
2. Then click the button that says New Save

## Useful button commands
1. Load an auto save - L1+L2+R1+R2+right on d-pad
2. Save Anywhere - L1+L2+R2+Touchpad
3. Instantly kills Sora in order to try a boss again - R1+r2+L2+Touchpad
4. Pressing R on your keyboard will reload your current save back into the autosave.dat file. Once you do this, you can press the command to load an auto save and it will load it back up. This is useful when practicing things where you have to go through a loading zone, like chamber 3 skip.
